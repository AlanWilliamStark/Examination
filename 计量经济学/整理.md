# 	1 Sample, Sample characteristics (mean, variance, standard deviation, mode median, quantile).

样本、样本特征（均值、方差、标准差、众数中位数、分位数）。

**Sample:** a sample is a set of individuals or objects collected or selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure.

**Sample characteristics:**

**mean:** For a [data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set), the *[arithmetic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean)*, also known as arithmetic average, is a central value of a finite set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values.

**variance:** variance is the [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of the squared [deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviation_(statistics)) of a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) from its [population mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_mean) or [sample mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean). Variance is a measure of [dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion), meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.

**standard deviation:** the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or [dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion) of a set of values.

**mode:** The **mode** is the value that appears most often in a set of data values.

**median:** the **median** is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample. For a [data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set), it may be thought of as "the middle" value.

**quantile:** **uantiles** are cut points dividing the [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)) of a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the [observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_(statistics)) in a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)) in the same way. There is one fewer quantile than the number of groups created. **分位数**是将[概率分布](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution)[的范围](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics))划分为具有相等概率的连续区间的切点，或者以相同的方式将[样本](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics))中的除以[观测值](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_(statistics))。分位数比创建的组数少一个。

**Nonlinear regression: ** **nonlinear regression** is a form of [regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) in which observational data are modeled by a function which is a nonlinear combination of the model parameters and depends on one or more independent variables. The data are fitted by a method of successive approximations.
